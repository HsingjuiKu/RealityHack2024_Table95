# MIT Reality Hackthon 2024
# Name: We Need Snack

## Introduction

In an era where technology intersects with sustainability, our project for the 'Living Harmony' track at MIT Reality Hack reimagines urban living through Extended Reality (XR). We're not just innovating; we're connecting humanity with nature, embodying the philosophy of unity between humans and the environment.

## Storytelling: "Synergy & Survival"

In the near future, Earth faces its darkest moment, teetering on the brink due to pollution and overpopulation. However, the choices we make today define our future. Will we persist on a path of destruction, or will we embrace a new, sustainable era?

Our educational game "Synergy & Survival" offers a unique perspective on ecosystems, addressing the interconnectedness of animals and humans. It emphasizes the importance of renewable energy, aiming to protect the environment from further disruption. This game not only connects the city with its ecosystem but also focuses on promoting the wider use of renewable energy.

The type of energy and cultural elements in the game are adaptable to suit the needs of our target audiences, particularly museums and renewable energy providers.

## Core Pillars Addressed

### Urban Symbiosis
Our XR application fosters a deep bond between urban dwellers and their environment. By integrating virtual urban planning with green spaces optimization and AR for waste management, we educate about sustainable urban living.

### Resource Circularity
We embrace circular economy principles, visualizing waste management and carbon footprint reduction through immersive VR and AR technologies.

### Climate Resilience
Our XR solutions predict and tackle climate challenges, empowering communities to engage in climate action.

## Alignment with UN SDGs

- **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)**: Our XR solutions make urban living inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.
- **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)**: We focus on sustainable consumption patterns and resource circularity.
- **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**: Our project combats climate change impacts, fostering urban climate resilience.

## Our Philosophy: Harmony in Interaction

Harmony is not just a concept; it's the soul of our project. Our dual gameplay perspectives – the urban planner and the raccoon – illustrate the intimate connection between humans and nature. This interactivity reflects our belief in mutual prosperity and shared destiny, embodying the philosophy of unity between humans and nature.

## Why We Stand Out

Our project goes beyond technology. It's a testament to human-nature harmony, a unique blend of philosophical depth and interactive technology showcasing the symbiotic relationship between humans and the environment. It's not just a game; it's a vision for a sustainable, harmonious future.

## Technical Stack

- **VR Headset**: Meta Quest 3
- **Development Tools**: Unity, C#

This concise yet impactful presentation content encapsulates the essence of our project, highlighting its relevance, innovation, and alignment with global sustainability goals. It effectively communicates why our project is not only suitable for the competition but also stands out as a reflection of deep philosophical and technological integration.
